								<h2>KENYA REGISTERED COMMUNITY HEALTH NURSING/ REGISTERED NURSE (RN)</h2>
							</header>
							
							<p>Registered Nursing (RN) requires a large base of knowledge used to assess, plan and intervene to promote health, prevent disease and help patients cope with illness. When providing direct patient care, nurses observe, assess and record symptoms, reactions and progress, which provides the basis for care planning and intervention. They are health educators and advocates for patients, families and communities.<p>

                            <p>Privately and internationally RNs enjoy a market that cannot be equal to any other health specialist, because of their comprehensive training skills and knowledge above basic expectations.<p>
                            <p>RNs have a unique scope of practice and can practice independently, although they also collaborate with all members of the health care team to provide the care needed by each patient as an individual.<p>
